Ever wished you had more control over the configuration of your [LUNCH**MATES**][lunchmates] comunity? We got you covered with our new premium communities!

With [LUNCH**MATES**][lunchmates] Premium, you will have access to an overview where you can see every indivdual matching and a pretty network graph that will show you how the network inside your community grows. In addition to that, you can go in stealth mode and hide your community in the public directory, so only people with the direct link can see your community.

Thereâ€™s also now a limit of 30 users for all standard free communities created from now on. If you signed up for [LUNCH**MATES**][lunchmates] before February 15, 2016 you can still continue using your community without the 30 user limit.

Go and [check out all features of premium now][premium]!
